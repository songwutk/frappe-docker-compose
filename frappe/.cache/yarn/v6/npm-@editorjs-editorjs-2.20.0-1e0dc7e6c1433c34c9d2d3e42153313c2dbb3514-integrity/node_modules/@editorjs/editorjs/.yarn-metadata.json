Blocks are structural units, of which the Entry is composed.\nFor example, `Paragraph`, `Heading`, `Image`, `Video`, `List` are Blocks. Each Block is represented by Plugin.\nWe have [many](http://github.com/editor-js/) ready-to-use Plugins and a [simple API](https://editorjs.io/tools-api) for creating new ones.\n\nHow to use the Editor after [Installation](https://editorjs.io/getting-started).\n\n- Create new Blocks by pressing Enter or clicking the Plus Button\n- Press `TAB` or click on the Plus Button to view the Toolbox\n- Press `TAB` again to leaf Toolbox and select a Block you need. Then press Enter.\n\n\n ![](https://github.com/editor-js/list/raw/master/assets/example.gif)\n\n- Select a text fragment and apply a style or insert a link from the Inline Toolbar\n\n![](https://capella.pics/7ccbcfcd-1c49-4674-bea7-71021468a1bd.jpg)\n\n- Use the ¬´three-dots¬ª button on the right to open Block Settings. From here, you can move and delete a Block\nor apply a Tool's settings, if it provided. For example, you can set a Heading level or List style.\n\n![](https://capella.pics/01a55381-46cd-47c7-b92e-34765434f2ca.jpg)\n\n### Shortcuts\n\nA few shortcuts are preset as available.\n\nShortcut | Action | Restrictions\n-- | -- | --\n`TAB` | Show/leaf a Toolbox. | On empty block\n`SHIFT+TAB` | Leaf back a Toolbox. | While Toolbox is opened\n`ENTER` | Create a Block | While Toolbox is opened and some Tool is selected\n`CMD+B` | Bold style | On selection\n`CMD+I` | Italic style | On selection\n`CMD+K` | Insert a link | On selection\n\nEach Tool can also have its own shortcuts. These are specified in the configuration of the Tool, for example:\n\n```js\nvar editor = new EditorJS({\n  //...\n  tools: {\n    header: {\n      class: Header,\n      shortcut: 'CMD+SHIFT+H'\n    },\n    list: {\n      class: List,\n      shortcut: 'CMD+SHIFT+L'\n    }\n  }\n  //...\n });\n\n```\n\n\n## Installation Guide\n\nThere are few steps to run Editor.js on your site.\n\n1. [Load Editor's core](#load-editors-core)\n2. [Load Tools](#load-tools)\n3. [Initialize Editor's instance](#create-editor-instance)\n\n### Step 1. Load Editor's core\n\nGet Editor.js itself. It is a [minified script](dist/editor.js) with Editor's core and some default must-have tools.\n\nChoose the most usable method of getting Editor for you.\n\n- Node package\n- Source from CDN\n\n##### Option A. NPM install\n\nInstall the package via NPM or Yarn\n\n```shell\nnpm i @editorjs/editorjs\n```\n\nInclude module in your application\n\n```javascript\nimport EditorJS from '@editorjs/editorjs';\n```\n\n##### Option B. Use a CDN\n\nYou can load EditorJS directly from from [jsDelivr CDN](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@editorjs/editorjs).\n\n`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@editorjs/editorjs@latest`\n\nFor example, place this in your HTML:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@editorjs/editorjs@latest\"></script>\n```\n\nOr download the bundle file and use it from your server.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"editor.js\"></script>\n```\n\n### Step 2. Load the Tools that you want to make available\n\nEach Block is represented by a [Tool](docs/tools.md). Tools are simple external scripts with their own logic. For example, there is a [Header](https://github.com/editor-js/header) Tool into which you type your heading text. If you want to be able to use this, install the Header Tool the same way as the Editor (Node.js, CDN, local file).\n\n**Example:** use Header from CDN\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/codex.editor.header@2.0.4/dist/bundle.js\"></script>\n```\n\nCheck [Editor.js's community](https://github.com/editor-js/) to see more ready-to-use Tools.\n\n### Step 3. Create Editor instance\n\nCreate an instance of Editor.js and pass [Configuration Object](types/configs/editor-config.d.ts) with `holderId` and tools list.\n\n```html\n<div id=\"editorjs\"></div>\n```\n\nYou can create a simple Editor with only default Paragraph Tool by passing a string with element's Id (wrapper for Editor) as a configuration param. Or use the default `editorjs` id for wrapper.\n\n```javascript\nvar editor = new EditorJS(); /** Zero-configuration */\n\n// equals\n\nvar editor = new EditorJS('editorjs');\n````\n\nOr pass a whole settings object.\n\n```javascript\nvar editor = new EditorJS({\n    /**\n     * Create a holder for the Editor and pass its ID\n     */\n    holder : 'editorjs',\n\n    /**\n     * Available Tools list.\n     * Pass Tool's class or Settings object for each Tool you want to use\n     */\n    tools: {\n        header: {\n          class: Header,\n          inlineToolbar : true\n        },\n        // ...\n    },\n\n    /**\n     * Previously saved data that should be rendered\n     */\n    data: {}\n});\n```\n\n### Saving Data\n\nCall `editor.save()` and handle returned Promise with saved data.\n\n```javascript\neditor.save()\n  .then((savedData) => {\n    console.log(savedData);\n  });\n```\n\n### Example\n\nTake a look at the [example.html](example/example.html) to view more detailed examples.\n\n## Credits and references\n\n- We use [HTMLJanitor](https://github.com/guardian/html-janitor) module in our Sanitizer module.\n\n## About team\n\nWe are CodeX and we build products for developers and makers.\n\nFollow us on Twitter: [twitter.com/codex_team](https://twitter.com/codex_team)\n\nFeel free to contact: <a href=\"mailto:team@codex.so?subject=Editor.js feedback\">team@codex.so</a>\n\n[codex.so](https://codex.so)\n",
