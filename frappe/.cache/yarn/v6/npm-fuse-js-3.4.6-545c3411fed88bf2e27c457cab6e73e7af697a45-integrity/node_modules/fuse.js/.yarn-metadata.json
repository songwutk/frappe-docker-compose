Maintaining and updating it takes up a good chunk of time, and there's still plenty of work to do. To be able to provide the project with the attention it deserves, I decided to experiment with sponsorship and/or support. If this works out, I can route the chunk of time that is usually spent on lucrative endeavors to this project.\n\nIf you'd like to join the list of these awesome [backers](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse/blob/master/backers.md), please consider:\n\n- [Become a backer or sponsor on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/fusejs).\n- [One-time donation via PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/kirorisk)\n\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Special Sponsors</h3>\n<!--special start-->\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <i>[Get your company name here]</i>\n</p>\n  \n<!--special end-->\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nFuse.js is a lightweight fuzzy-search, in JavaScript, with zero dependencies.\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo checkout out [live examples](https://fusejs.io) and docs, visit [fusejs.io](https://fusejs.io).\n\n## Installation\n\n__NPM__\n\nNPM is the recommended installation method.

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
