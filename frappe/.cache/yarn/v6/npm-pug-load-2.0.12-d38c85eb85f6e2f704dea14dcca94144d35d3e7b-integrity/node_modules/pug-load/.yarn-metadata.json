    "readme": "# pug-load\n\nThe pug loader is responsible for loading the depenendencies of a given pug file.  It adds `fullPath` and `str` properties to every `Include` and `Extends` node.  It also adds an `ast` property to any `Include` nodes that are loading pug and any `Extends` nodes.  It then recursively loads the dependencies of any of those included files.\n\n[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/pugjs/pug-load/master.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/pugjs/pug-load)\n[![Dependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug/status.svg?path=packages/pug-load)](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug?path=packages/pug-load)\n[![DevDependencies Status](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug/dev-status.svg?path=packages/pug-load)](https://david-dm.org/pugjs/pug?path=packages/pug-load&type=dev)\n[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pug-load.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/pug-load)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/pugjs/pug-load.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pugjs/pug-load)\n\n## Installation\n\n    npm install pug-load\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar load = require('pug-load');\n```\n\n### `load(ast, options)`\n### `load.string(str, filename, options)`\n### `load.file(filename, options)`\n\nLoads all dependencies of the Pug AST. `load.string` and `load.file` are syntactic sugar that parses the string or file instead of you doing it yourself.\n\n`options` may contain the following properties:\n\n- `lex` (function): **(required)** the lexer used\n- `parse` (function): **(required)** the parser used\n- `resolve` (function): a function used to override `load.resolve`. Defaults to `load.resolve`.\n- `read` (function): a function used to override `load.read`. Defaults to `load.read`.\n- `basedir` (string): the base directory of absolute inclusion. This is **required** when absolute inclusion (file name starts with `'/'`) is used. Defaults to undefined.\n\nThe `options` object is passed to `load.resolve` and `load.read`, or equivalently `options.resolve` and `options.read`.\n\n### `load.resolve(filename, source, options)`\n\nCallback used by `pug-load` to resolve the full path of an included or extended file given the path of the source file.\n\n`filename` is the included file. `source` is the name of the parent file that includes `filename`.\n\nThis function is not meant to be called from outside of `pug-load`, but rather for you to override.\n\n### `load.read(filename, options)`\n\nCallback used by `pug-load` to return the contents of a file.\n\n`filename` is the file to read.\n\nThis function is not meant to be called from outside of `pug-load`, but rather for you to override.\n\n### `load.validateOptions(options)`\n\nCallback used `pug-load` to ensure the options object is valid. If your overriden `load.resolve` or `load.read` uses a different `options` scheme, you will need to override this function as well.\n\nThis function is not meant to be called from outside of `pug-load`, but rather for you to override.\n\n### Example\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar lex = require('pug-lexer');\nvar parse = require('pug-parser');\nvar load = require('pug-load');\n\n// you can do everything very manually\n\nvar str = fs.readFileSync('bar.pug', 'utf8');\nvar ast = load(parse(lex(str, 'bar.pug'), 'bar.pug'), {\n  lex: lex,\n  parse: parse,\n  resolve: function (filename, source, options) {\n    console.log('\"' + filename + '\" file requested from \"' + source + '\".');\n    return load.resolve(filename, source, options);\n  }\n});\n\n// or you can do all that in just two steps\n\nvar str = fs.readFileSync('bar.pug', 'utf8');\nvar ast = load.string(str, 'bar.pug', {\n  lex: lex,\n  parse: parse,\n  resolve: function (filename, source, options) {\n    console.log('\"' + filename + '\" file requested from \"' + source + '\".');\n    return load.resolve(filename, source, options);\n  }\n});\n\n// or you can do all that in only one step\n\nvar ast = load.file('bar.pug', {\n  lex: lex,\n  parse: parse,\n  resolve: function (filename, source, options) {\n    console.log('\"' + filename + '\" file requested from \"' + source + '\".');\n    return load.resolve(filename, source, options);\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## License\n\n  MIT\n",
