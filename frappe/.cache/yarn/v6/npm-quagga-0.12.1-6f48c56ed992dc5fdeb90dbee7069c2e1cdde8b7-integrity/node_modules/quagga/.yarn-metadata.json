The library is also capable of using\n`getUserMedia` to get direct access to the user's camera stream. Although the\ncode relies on heavy image-processing even recent smartphones are capable of\nlocating and decoding barcodes in real-time.\n\nTry some [examples](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/examples) and check out\nthe blog post ([How barcode-localization works in QuaggaJS][oberhofer_co_how])\nif you want to dive deeper into this topic.\n\n![teaser][teaser_left]![teaser][teaser_right]\n\n\n## Yet another barcode library?\n\nThis is not yet another port of the great [zxing][zxing_github] library, but\nmore of an extension to it. This implementation features a barcode locator which\nis capable of finding a barcode-like pattern in an image resulting in an\nestimated bounding box including the rotation. Simply speaking, this reader is\ninvariant to scale and rotation, whereas other libraries require the barcode to\nbe aligned with the viewport.\n\n\n## <a name=\"browser-support\">Browser Support</a>\n\nQuagga makes use of many modern Web-APIs which are not implemented by all\nbrowsers yet. There are two modes in which Quagga operates: 1. analyzing static\nimages and 2. using a camera to decode the images from a live-stream. The latter\nrequires the presence of the MediaDevices API. You can track the compatibility\nof the used Web-APIs for each mode:\n\n- [Static Images](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers,canvas,typedarrays,bloburls,blobbuilder)\n- [Live Stream](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers,canvas,typedarrays,bloburls,blobbuilder,stream)\n\n### Static Images\n\nThe following APIs need to be implemented in your browser:\n- [webworkers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=webworkers)\n- [canvas](http://caniuse.com/#feat=canvas)\n- [typedarrays](http://caniuse.com/#feat=typedarrays)\n- [bloburls](http://caniuse.com/#feat=bloburls)\n- [blobbuilder](http://caniuse.com/#feat=blobbuilder)\n\n### Live Stream\n\nIn addition to the APIs mentioned above:\n- [MediaDevices](http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream)\n\n__Important:__ Accessing `getUserMedia` requires a secure origin in most\nbrowsers, meaning that `http://` can only be used on `localhost`. All other\nhostnames need to be served via `https://`. You can find more information in the\n[Chrome M47 WebRTC Release Notes](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/discuss-webrtc/sq5CVmY69sc).\n\n### Feature-detection of getUserMedia\n\nEvery browser seems to differently implement the `mediaDevices.getUserMedia`\nAPI. Therefore it's highly recommended to include\n[webrtc-adapter](https://github.com/webrtc/adapter) in your project.\n\nHere's how you can test your browser's capabilities:\n\n```javascript\nif (navigator.mediaDevices && typeof navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia === 'function') {\n  // safely access `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`\n}\n```\n\nThe above condition evaluates to:\n\n| Browser       | result  |\n| ------------- |:-------:|\n| Edge          | `true`  |\n| Chrome        | `true`  |\n| Firefox       | `true`  |\n| IE 11         | `false` |\n| Safari iOS    | `false` |\n\n## <a name=\"installing\">Installing</a>\n\nQuaggaJS can be installed using __npm__, __bower__, or by including it with\nthe __script__ tag.\n\n### NPM\n\n```console\n> npm install quagga\n```\n\nAnd then import it as dependency in your project:\n\n```javascript\nimport Quagga from 'quagga'; // ES6\nconst Quagga = require('quagga').default; // Common JS (important: default)\n```\n\nCurrently, the full functionality is only available through the browser. When\nusing QuaggaJS within __node__, only file-based decoding is available. See the\nexample for [node_examples](#node-example).\n\n### Bower\n\nYou can also install QuaggaJS through __bower__:\n\n```console\n> bower install quagga\n```\n\n### Script-Tag Anno 1998\n\nYou can simply include `dist/quagga.min.js` in your project and you are ready\nto go. The script exposes the library on the global namespace under `Quagga`.\n\n\n## <a name=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started</a>\n\nFor starters, have a look at the [examples][github_examples] to get an idea\nwhere to go from here.\n\n\n## <a name=\"Building\">Building</a>\n\nYou can build the library yourself by simply cloning the repo and typing:\n\n```console\n> npm install\n> npm run build\n```\n\nThis npm script builds a non optimized version `quagga.js` and a minified\nversion `quagga.min.js` and places both files in the `dist` folder.\nAdditionally, a `quagga.map` source-map is placed alongside these files. This\nfile is only valid for the non-uglified version `quagga.js` because the\nminified version is altered after compression and does not align with the map\nfile any more.\n\n### Node\n\nThe code in the `dist` folder is only targeted to the browser and won't work in\nnode due to the dependency on the DOM. For the use in node, the `build` command\nalso creates a `quagga.js` file in the `lib` folder.\n\n## <a name=\"api\">API</a>\n\nYou can check out the [examples][github_examples] to get an idea of how to\nuse QuaggaJS. Basically the library exposes the following API:\n\n### <a name=\"quaggainit\">Quagga.init(config, callback)</a>\n\nThis method initializes the library for a given configuration `config` (see\nbelow) and invokes the `callback(err)` when Quagga has finished its\nbootstrapping phase. The initialization process also requests for camera\naccess if real-time detection is configured. In case of an error, the `err`\nparameter is set and contains information about the cause. A potential cause\nmay be the `inputStream.type` is set to `LiveStream`, but the browser does\nnot support this API, or simply if the user denies the permission to use the\ncamera.\n\nIf you do not specify a target, QuaggaJS would look for an element that matches\nthe CSS selector `#interactive.viewport` (for backwards compatibility).\n`target` can be a string (CSS selector matching one of your DOM node) or a DOM\nnode.\n\n```javascript\nQuagga.init({\n    inputStream : {\n      name : \"Live\",\n      type : \"LiveStream\",\n      target: document.querySelector('#yourElement')    // Or '#yourElement' (optional)\n    },\n    decoder : {\n      readers : [\"code_128_reader\"]\n    }\n  }, function(err) {\n      if (err) {\n          console.log(err);\n          return\n      }\n      console.log(\"Initialization finished. Ready to start\");\n      Quagga.start();\n  });\n```\n\n### Quagga.start()\n\nWhen the library is initialized, the `start()` method starts the video-stream\nand begins locating and decoding the images.\n\n### Quagga.stop()\n\nIf the decoder is currently running, after calling `stop()` the decoder does not\nprocess any more images. Additionally, if a camera-stream was requested upon\ninitialization, this operation also disconnects the camera.\n\n### Quagga.onProcessed(callback)\n\nThis method registers a `callback(data)` function that is called for each frame\nafter the processing is done. The `data` object contains detailed information\nabout the success/failure of the operation. The output varies, depending whether\nthe detection and/or decoding were successful or not.\n\n### Quagga.onDetected(callback)\n\nRegisters a `callback(data)` function which is triggered whenever a barcode-\npattern has been located and decoded successfully. The passed `data` object\ncontains information about the decoding process including the detected code\nwhich can be obtained by calling `data.codeResult.code`.\n\n### Quagga.decodeSingle(config, callback)\n\nIn contrast to the calls described above, this method does not rely on\n`getUserMedia` and operates on a single image instead. The provided callback\nis the same as in `onDetected` and contains the result `data` object.\n\n### Quagga.offProcessed(handler)\n\nIn case the `onProcessed` event is no longer relevant, `offProcessed` removes\nthe given `handler` from the event-queue.\n\n### Quagga.offDetected(handler)\n\nIn case the `onDetected` event is no longer relevant, `offDetected` removes\nthe given `handler` from the event-queue.\n\n## <a name=\"resultobject\">The result object</a>\n\nThe callbacks passed into `onProcessed`, `onDetected` and `decodeSingle`\nreceive a `data` object upon execution. The `data` object contains the following\ninformation. Depending on the success, some fields may be `undefined` or just\nempty.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  \"codeResult\": {\n    \"code\": \"FANAVF1461710\",  // the decoded code as a string\n    \"format\": \"code_128\", // or code_39, codabar, ean_13, ean_8, upc_a, upc_e\n    \"start\": 355,\n    \"end\": 26,\n    \"codeset\": 100,\n    \"startInfo\": {\n      \"error\": 1.0000000000000002,\n      \"code\": 104,\n      \"start\": 21,\n      \"end\": 41\n    },\n    \"decodedCodes\": [{\n      \"code\": 104,\n      \"start\": 21,\n      \"end\": 41\n    },\n    // stripped for brevity\n    {\n      \"error\": 0.8888888888888893,\n      \"code\": 106,\n      \"start\": 328,\n      \"end\": 350\n    }],\n    \"endInfo\": {\n      \"error\": 0.8888888888888893,\n      \"code\": 106,\n      \"start\": 328,\n      \"end\": 350\n    },\n    \"direction\": -1\n  },\n  \"line\": [{\n    \"x\": 25.97278706156836,\n    \"y\": 360.5616435369468\n  }, {\n    \"x\": 401.9220519377024,\n    \"y\": 70.87524989906444\n  }],\n  \"angle\": -0.6565217179979483,\n  \"pattern\": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, /* ... */ 1],\n  \"box\": [\n    [77.4074243622672, 410.9288668804402],\n    [0.050203235235130705, 310.53619724086366],\n    [360.15706727788256, 33.05711026051813],\n    [437.5142884049146, 133.44977990009465]\n  ],\n  \"boxes\": [\n    [\n      [77.4074243622672, 410.9288668804402],\n      [0.050203235235130705, 310.53619724086366],\n      [360.15706727788256, 33.05711026051813],\n      [437.5142884049146, 133.44977990009465]\n    ],\n    [\n      [248.90769330706507, 415.2041489551161],\n      [198.9532321622869, 352.62160512937635],\n      [339.546160777576, 240.3979259789976],\n      [389.5006219223542, 302.98046980473737]\n    ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## <a name=\"configobject\">Configuration</a>\n\nThe configuration that ships with QuaggaJS covers the default use-cases and can\nbe fine-tuned for specific requirements.\n\nThe configuration is managed by the `config` object defining the following\nhigh-level properties:\n\n```javascript\n{\n  numOfWorkers: 4,\n  locate: true,\n  inputStream: {...},\n  frequency: 10,\n  decoder:{...},\n  locator: {...},\n  debug: false,\n}\n```\n\n### numOfWorkers\n\nQuaggaJS supports web-workers out of the box and runs with `4` workers in its\ndefault configuration. The number should align with the number of cores\navailable in your targeted devices.\n\nIn case you don't know the number upfront, or if the variety of devices is\ntoo big, you can either use `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` (see\n[here](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Navigator_HW_Concurrency)) where available\nor make use of [core-estimator](https://github.com/oftn/core-estimator).\n\n### locate\n\nOne of the main features of QuaggaJS is its ability to locate a barcode in a\ngiven image. The `locate` property controls whether this feature is turned on\n(default) or off.\n\nWhy would someone turn this feature off? Localizing a barcode is a\ncomputationally expensive operation and might not work properly on some\ndevices. Another reason would be the lack of auto-focus producing blurry\nimages which makes the localization feature very unstable.\n\nHowever, even if none of the above apply, there is one more case where it might\nbe useful to disable `locate`: If the orientation, and/or the approximate\nposition of the barcode is known, or if you want to guide the user through a\nrectangular outline. This can increase performance and robustness at the same\ntime.\n\n### inputStream\n\nThe `inputStream` property defines the sources of images/videos within QuaggaJS.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  name: \"Live\",\n  type: \"LiveStream\",\n  constraints: {\n    width: 640,\n    height: 480,\n    facingMode: \"environment\",\n    deviceId: \"7832475934759384534\"\n  },\n  area: { // defines rectangle of the detection/localization area\n    top: \"0%\",    // top offset\n    right: \"0%\",  // right offset\n    left: \"0%\",   // left offset\n    bottom: \"0%\"  // bottom offset\n  },\n  singleChannel: false // true: only the red color-channel is read\n}\n```\n\nFirst, the `type` property can be set to three different values:\n`ImageStream`, `VideoStream`, or `LiveStream` (default) and should be selected\ndepending on the use-case. Most probably, the default value is sufficient.\n\nSecond, the `constraint` key defines the physical dimensions of the input image\nand additional properties, such as `facingMode` which sets the source of the\nuser's camera in case of multiple attached devices. Additionally, if required,\nthe `deviceId` can be set if the selection of the camera is given to the user.\nThis can be easily achieved via\n[MediaDevices.enumerateDevices()][enumerateDevices]\n\nThirdly, the `area` prop restricts the decoding area of the image. The values\nare given in percentage, similar to the CSS style property when using\n`position: absolute`. This `area` is also useful in cases the `locate` property\nis set to `false`, defining the rectangle for the user.\n\nThe last key `singleChannel` is only relevant in cases someone wants to debug\nerroneous behavior of the decoder. If set to `true` the input image's red\ncolor-channel is read instead of calculating the gray-scale values of the\nsource's RGB. This is useful in combination with the `ResultCollector` where\nthe gray-scale representations of the wrongly identified images are saved.\n\n### frequency\n\nThis top-level property controls the scan-frequency of the video-stream. It's\noptional and defines the maximum number of scans per second. This renders\nuseful for cases where the scan-session is long-running and resources such as\nCPU power are of concern.\n\n### decoder\n\nQuaggaJS usually runs in a two-stage manner (`locate` is set to `true`) where,\nafter the barcode is located, the decoding process starts. Decoding is the\nprocess of converting the bars into its true meaning. Most of the configuration\noptions within the `decoder` are for debugging/visualization purposes only.\n\n```javascript\n{\n  readers: [\n    'code_128_reader'\n  ],\n  debug: {\n      drawBoundingBox: false,\n      showFrequency: false,\n      drawScanline: false,\n      showPattern: false\n  }\n  multiple: false\n}\n```\n\nThe most important property is `readers` which takes an array of types of\nbarcodes which should be decoded during the session. Possible values are:\n\n- code_128_reader (default)\n- ean_reader\n- ean_8_reader\n- code_39_reader\n- code_39_vin_reader\n- codabar_reader\n- upc_reader\n- upc_e_reader\n- i2of5_reader\n- 2of5_reader\n- code_93_reader\n\nWhy are not all types activated by default? Simply because one should\nexplicitly define the set of barcodes for their use-case. More decoders means\nmore possible clashes, or false-positives. One should take care of the order\nthe readers are given, since some might return a value even though it is not\nthe correct type (EAN-13 vs. UPC-A).\n\nThe `multiple` property tells the decoder if it should continue decoding after\nfinding a valid barcode.  If multiple is set to `true`, the results will be\nreturned as an array of result objects.  Each object in the array will have a\n`box`, and may have a `codeResult` depending on the success of decoding the\nindividual box.\n\nThe remaining properties `drawBoundingBox`, `showFrequency`, `drawScanline` and\n`showPattern` are mostly of interest during debugging and visualization.\n\n#### <a name=\"ean_extended\">Enabling extended EAN</a>\n\nThe default setting for `ean_reader` is not capable of reading extensions such\nas [EAN-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAN_2) or\n[EAN-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAN_5). In order to activate those\nsupplements you have to provide them in the configuration as followed:\n\n```javascript\ndecoder: {\n    readers: [{\n        format: \"ean_reader\",\n        config: {\n            supplements: [\n                'ean_5_reader', 'ean_2_reader'\n            ]\n        }\n    }]\n}\n```\n\nBeware that the order of the `supplements` matters in such that the reader stops\ndecoding when the first supplement was found. So if you are interested in EAN-2\nand EAN-5 extensions, use the order depicted above.\n\nIt's important to mention that, if supplements are supplied, regular EAN-13\ncodes cannot be read any more with the same reader. If you want to read EAN-13\nwith and without extensions you have to add another `ean_reader` reader to the\nconfiguration.\n\n### locator\n\nThe `locator` config is only relevant if the `locate` flag is set to `true`.\nIt controls the behavior of the localization-process and needs to be adjusted\nfor each specific use-case. The default settings are simply a combination of\nvalues which worked best during development.\n\nOnly two properties are relevant for the use in Quagga (`halfSample` and\n`patchSize`) whereas the rest is only needed for development and debugging.\n\n\n```javascript\n{\n  halfSample: true,\n  patchSize: \"medium\", // x-small, small, medium, large, x-large\n  debug: {\n    showCanvas: false,\n    showPatches: false,\n    showFoundPatches: false,\n    showSkeleton: false,\n    showLabels: false,\n    showPatchLabels: false,\n    showRemainingPatchLabels: false,\n    boxFromPatches: {\n      showTransformed: false,\n      showTransformedBox: false,\n      showBB: false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `halfSample` flag tells the locator-process whether it should operate on an\nimage scaled down (half width/height, quarter pixel-count ) or not. Turning\n`halfSample` on reduces the processing-time significantly and also helps\nfinding a barcode pattern due to implicit smoothing.\nIt should be turned off in cases where the barcode is really small and the full\nresolution is needed to find the position. It's recommended to keep it turned\non and use a higher resolution video-image if needed.\n\nThe second property `patchSize` defines the density of the search-grid. The\nproperty accepts strings of the value `x-small`, `small`, `medium`, `large` and\n`x-large`. The `patchSize` is proportional to the size of the scanned barcodes.\nIf you have really large barcodes which can be read close-up, then the use of\n`large` or `x-large` is recommended. In cases where the barcode is further away\nfrom the camera lens (lack of auto-focus, or small barcodes) then it's advised\nto set the size to `small` or even `x-small`. For the latter it's also\nrecommended to crank up the resolution in order to find a barcode.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following example takes an image `src` as input and prints the result on the\nconsole. The decoder is configured to detect _Code128_ barcodes and enables the\nlocating-mechanism for more robust results.\n\n```javascript\nQuagga.decodeSingle({\n    decoder: {\n        readers: [\"code_128_reader\"] // List of active readers\n    },\n    locate: true, // try to locate the barcode in the image\n    src: '/test/fixtures/code_128/image-001.jpg' // or 'data:image/jpg;base64,' + data\n}, function(result){\n    if(result.codeResult) {\n        console.log(\"result\", result.codeResult.code);\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"not detected\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### <a name=\"node-example\">Using node</a>\n\nThe following example illustrates the use of QuaggaJS within a node\nenvironment. It's almost identical to the browser version with the difference\nthat node does not support web-workers out of the box. Therefore the config\nproperty `numOfWorkers` must be explicitly set to `0`.\n\n```javascript\nvar Quagga = require('quagga').default;\n\nQuagga.decodeSingle({\n    src: \"image-abc-123.jpg\",\n    numOfWorkers: 0,  // Needs to be 0 when used within node\n    inputStream: {\n        size: 800  // restrict input-size to be 800px in width (long-side)\n    },\n    decoder: {\n        readers: [\"code_128_reader\"] // List of active readers\n    },\n}, function(result) {\n    if(result.codeResult) {\n        console.log(\"result\", result.codeResult.code);\n    } else {\n        console.log(\"not detected\");\n    }\n});\n```\n\n## <a name=\"tipsandtricks\">Tips & Tricks</a>\n\nA growing collection of tips & tricks to improve the various aspects of Quagga.\n\n### Barcodes too small?\n\nBarcodes too far away from the camera, or a lens too close to the object\nresult in poor recognition rates and Quagga might respond with a lot of\nfalse-positives.\n\nStarting in Chrome 59 you can now make use of `capabilities` and directly\ncontrol the zoom of the camera. Head over to the\n[web-cam demo](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/examples/live_w_locator.html)\nand check out the __Zoom__ feature.\n\nYou can read more about those `capabilities` in\n[Let's light a torch and explore MediaStreamTrack's capabilities](https://www.oberhofer.co/mediastreamtrack-and-its-capabilities)\n\n### Video too dark?\n\nDark environments usually result in noisy images and therefore mess with the\nrecognition logic.\n\nSince Chrome 59 you can turn on/off the __Torch__ of our device and vastly\nimprove the quality of the images. Head over to the\n[web-cam demo](https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/examples/live_w_locator.html)\nand check out the __Torch__ feature.\n\nTo find out more about this feature [read on](https://www.oberhofer.co/mediastreamtrack-and-its-capabilities).\n\n## Tests\n\nUnit Tests can be run with [Karma][karmaUrl] and written using\n[Mocha][mochaUrl], [Chai][chaiUrl] and [SinonJS][sinonUrl]. Coverage reports are\nautomatically generated in the coverage/ folder.\n\n```console\n> npm install\n> npm run test\n```\n## Image Debugging\n\nIn case you want to take a deeper dive into the inner workings of Quagga, get to\nknow the _debugging_ capabilities of the current implementation. The various\nflags exposed through the `config` object give you the abilily to visualize\nalmost every step in the processing. Because of the introduction of the\nweb-workers, and their restriction not to have access to the DOM, the\nconfiguration must be explicitly set to `config.numOfWorkers = 0` in order to\nwork.\n\n## <a name=\"resultcollector\">ResultCollector</a>\n\nQuagga is not perfect by any means and may produce false positives from time\nto time. In order to find out which images produced those false positives,\nthe built-in ``ResultCollector`` will support you and me helping squashing\nbugs in the implementation.\n\n### Creating a ``ResultCollector``\n\nYou can easily create a new ``ResultCollector`` by calling its ``create``\nmethod with a configuration.\n\n```javascript\nvar resultCollector = Quagga.ResultCollector.create({\n    capture: true, // keep track of the image producing this result\n    capacity: 20,  // maximum number of results to store\n    blacklist: [   // list containing codes which should not be recorded\n        {code: \"3574660239843\", format: \"ean_13\"}],\n    filter: function(codeResult) {\n        // only store results which match this constraint\n        // returns true/false\n        // e.g.: return codeResult.format === \"ean_13\";\n        return true;\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Using a ``ResultCollector``\n\nAfter creating a ``ResultCollector`` you have to attach it to Quagga by\ncalling ``Quagga.registerResultCollector(resultCollector)``.\n\n### Reading results\n\nAfter a test/recording session, you can now print the collected results which\ndo not fit into a certain schema. Calling ``getResults`` on the\n``resultCollector`` returns an ``Array`` containing objects with:\n\n```javascript\n{\n    codeResult: {}, // same as in onDetected event\n    frame: \"data:image/png;base64,iVBOR...\" // dataURL of the gray-scaled image\n}\n```\n\nThe ``frame`` property is an internal representation of the image and\ntherefore only available in gray-scale. The dataURL representation allows\neasy saving/rendering of the image.\n\n### Comparing results\n\nNow, having the frames available on disk, you can load each single image by\ncalling ``decodeSingle`` with the same configuration as used during recording\n. In order to reproduce the exact same result, you have to make sure to turn\non the ``singleChannel`` flag in the configuration when using ``decodeSingle``.\n\n## <a name=\"sponsors\">Sponsors</a>\n\n- [Maintenance Connection Canada (Asset Pro Solutions Inc.](http://maintenanceconnection.ca/)\n\n## <a name=\"changelog\">Changelog</a>\n\n### 2017-06-07\n- Improvements\n  -
