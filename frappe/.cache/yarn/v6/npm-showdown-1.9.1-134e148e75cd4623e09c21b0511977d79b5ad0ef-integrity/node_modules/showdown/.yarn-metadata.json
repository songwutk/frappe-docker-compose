However, maintaining and improving the library costs time and money.\n\nIf you like our work and find our library useful, please donate through [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/showdownjs) or directly through [paypal](https://www.paypal.me/tiviesantos)!! Your contribution will be greatly appreciated and help me continue to develop this awesome library.\n\n## License\n\nShowdown 1.x is released under GPL 2.0\n\n## Who uses Showdown (or a fork)\n\n - [GoogleCloudPlatform](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform)\n - [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)\n - [Stackexchange](http://stackexchange.com/) - forked as [PageDown](https://code.google.com/p/pagedown/)\n - [docular](https://github.com/Vertafore/docular)\n - [md-page](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page)\n - [and some others...](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/showdown)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Download tarball\n\nYou can download the latest release tarball directly from [releases][releases]\n\n### Bower\n\n    bower install showdown\n\n### npm (server-side)\n\n    npm install showdown\n\n### NuGet package\n\n    PM> Install-Package showdownjs\n\nThe NuGet Packages can be [found here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/showdownjs/).\n\n### CDN\n\nYou can also use one of several CDNs available: \n\n* github CDN\n\n        https://cdn.rawgit.com/showdownjs/showdown/<version tag>/dist/showdown.min.js\n\n* cdnjs\n\n        https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/showdown/<version tag>/showdown.min.js\n\n\n## Browser Compatibility\n\nShowdown has been tested successfully with:\n\n  * Firefox 1.5 and 2.0\n  * Chrome 12.0\n  * Internet Explorer 6 and 7\n  * Safari 2.0.4\n  * Opera 8.54 and 9.10\n  * Netscape 8.1.2\n  * Konqueror 3.5.4\n\nIn theory, Showdown will work in any browser that supports ECMA 262 3rd Edition (JavaScript 1.5).\nThe converter itself might even work in things that aren't web browsers, like Acrobat.  No promises.\n\n\n## Node compatibility\n\nShowdown has been tested with node 6, 8 and 10. However, it should work with previous versions, such as node 0.12.\n\n\n## Legacy version\n\nIf you're looking for showdown v<1.0.0, you can find it in the [**legacy branch**][legacy-branch].\n\n## Changelog\n\nYou can check the full [changelog][changelog]\n\n## Extended documentation\nCheck our [wiki pages][wiki] for examples and a more in-depth documentation.\n\n\n## Quick Example\n\n### Node\n\n**Markdown to HTML**\n```js\nvar showdown  = require('showdown'),\n    converter = new showdown.Converter(),\n    text      = '# hello, markdown!',\n    html      = converter.makeHtml(text);\n```\n\n**HTML to Markdown**\n```js\nvar showdown  = require('showdown'),\n    converter = new showdown.Converter(),\n    html      = '<a href=\"https://patreon.com/showdownjs\">Please Support us!</a>',\n    md        = converter.makeMarkdown(text);\n```\n\n\n### Browser\n\n```js\nvar converter = new showdown.Converter(),\n    html      = converter.makeHtml('# hello, markdown!'),\n    md        = converter.makeMd('<a href=\"https://patreon.com/showdownjs\">Please Support us!</a>');\n```\n\n### Output \n\nBoth examples should output...\n\n```html\n    <h1 id=\"hellomarkdown\">hello, markdown!</h1>\n```\n\n```md\n[Please Support us!](https://patreon.com/showdownjs)\n```\n\n## Options\n\nYou can change some of showdown's default behavior through options. \n\n### Setting options\n\nOptions can be set:\n\n#### Globally\n\nSetting a \"global\" option affects all instances of showdown\n\n```js\nshowdown.setOption('optionKey', 'value');\n```\n\n#### Locally\nSetting a \"local\" option only affects the specified Converter object. \nLocal options can be set:\n\n * **through the constructor**\n    ```js\n    var converter = new showdown.Converter({optionKey: 'value'});\n    ```\n\n * **through the setOption() method**\n    ```js\n    var converter = new showdown.Converter();\n    converter.setOption('optionKey', 'value');\n    ```\n\n### Getting an option\n\nShowdown provides 2 methods (both local and global) to retrieve previous set options.\n\n#### getOption()\n\n```js\n// Global\nvar myOption = showdown.getOption('optionKey');\n\n//Local\nvar myOption = converter.getOption('optionKey');\n```\n\n#### getOptions()\n\n```js\n// Global\nvar showdownGlobalOptions = showdown.getOptions();\n\n//Local\nvar thisConverterSpecificOptions = converter.getOptions();\n```\n\n### Retrieve the default options\n\nYou can get showdown's default options with:\n```js\nvar defaultOptions = showdown.getDefaultOptions();\n```\n\n### Valid Options\n\n * **omitExtraWLInCodeBlocks**: (boolean) [default false] Omit the trailing newline in a code block. Ex:\n   \n    This:\n    ```html\n    <code><pre>var foo = 'bar';\n    </pre></code>\n    ```\n    Becomes this:\n    ```html\n    <code><pre>var foo = 'bar';</pre></code>\n    ```\n\n * **noHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] Disable the automatic generation of header ids.\n   Setting to true overrides **prefixHeaderId**\n\n * **customizedHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] Use text in curly braces as header id. **(since v1.7.0)**\n   Example:\n   ```\n   ## Sample header {real-id}     will use real-id as id\n   ```\n\n * **ghCompatibleHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] Generate header ids compatible with github style\n   (spaces are replaced with dashes and a bunch of non alphanumeric chars are removed) **(since v1.5.5)**\n\n * **prefixHeaderId**: (string/boolean) [default false] Add a prefix to the generated header ids.\n   Passing a string will prefix that string to the header id. Setting to `true` will add a generic 'section' prefix.\n\n * **rawPrefixHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] Setting this option to true will prevent showdown from modifying the prefix.\n   This might result in malformed IDs (if, for instance, the \" char is used in the prefix).\n   Has no effect if prefixHeaderId is set to false. **(since v 1.7.3)**\n\n * **rawHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] Remove only spaces, ' and \" from generated header ids (including prefixes),\n    replacing them with dashes (-). WARNING: This might result in malformed ids **(since v1.7.3)**\n \n * **parseImgDimensions**: (boolean) [default false] Enable support for setting image dimensions from within markdown syntax.\n   Examples:\n   ```\n   ![foo](foo.jpg =100x80)     simple, assumes units are in px\n   ![bar](bar.jpg =100x*)      sets the height to \"auto\"\n   ![baz](baz.jpg =80%x5em)  Image with width of 80% and height of 5em\n   ```\n \n * **headerLevelStart**: (integer) [default 1] Set the header starting level. For instance, setting this to 3 means that\n\n    ```md\n    # foo\n    ```\n    will be parsed as \n    \n    ```html\n    <h3>foo</h3>\n    ```\n\n * **simplifiedAutoLink**: (boolean) [default false] Turning this option on will enable automatic linking to urls.\n   This means that:\n\n   ```md\n   some text www.google.com\n   ```\n   will be parsed as \n   ```html\n   <p>some text <a href=\"www.google.com\">www.google.com</a>\n   ```\n \n * **excludeTrailingPunctuationFromURLs**: (boolean) [default false] This option excludes trailing punctuation from autolinking urls.\n   Punctuation excluded: `. !  ? ( )`. Only applies if **simplifiedAutoLink** option is set to `true`.\n   \n   ```md\n   check this link www.google.com!\n   ```\n   will be parsed as\n   ```html\n   <p>check this link <a href=\"www.google.com\">www.google.com</a>!</p>\n   ```\n   \n * **literalMidWordUnderscores**: (boolean) [default false] Turning this on will stop showdown from interpreting\n   underscores in the middle of words as `<em>` and `<strong>` and instead treat them as literal underscores.\n\n   Example:\n   \n   ```md\n   some text with__underscores__in middle\n   ```\n   will be parsed as\n   ```html\n   <p>some text with__underscores__in middle</p>\n   ```\n\n * **literalMidWordAsterisks**: (boolean) [default false] Turning this on will stop showdown from interpreting asterisks\n   in the middle of words as `<em>` and `<strong>` and instead treat them as literal asterisks.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```md\n   some text with**underscores**in middle\n   ```\n   will be parsed as\n   ```html\n   <p>some text with**underscores**in middle</p>\n   ```\n   \n * **strikethrough**: (boolean) [default false] Enable support for strikethrough syntax.\n   `~~strikethrough~~` as `<del>strikethrough</del>`\n   \n * **tables**: (boolean) [default false] Enable support for tables syntax. Example:\n    \n   ```md\n   | h1    |    h2   |      h3 |\n   |:------|:-------:|--------:|\n   | 100   | [a][1]  | ![b][2] |\n   | *foo* | **bar** | ~~baz~~ |\n   ```\n   \n   See the wiki for more info\n\n * **tablesHeaderId**: (boolean) [default false] If enabled adds an id property to table headers tags.\n\n * **ghCodeBlocks**: (boolean) [default true] Enable support for GFM code block style.\n\n * **tasklists**: (boolean) [default false] Enable support for GFM tasklists. Example:\n \n   ```md\n    - [x] This task is done\n    - [ ] This is still pending\n   ```\n * **smoothLivePreview**: (boolean) [default false] Prevents weird effects in live previews due to incomplete input\n \n * **smartIndentationFix**: (boolean) [default false] Tries to smartly fix indentation problems related to es6 template\n   strings in the midst of indented code.\n\n * **disableForced4SpacesIndentedSublists**: (boolean) [default false] Disables the requirement of indenting sublists\n   by 4 spaces for them to be nested, effectively reverting to the old behavior where 2 or 3 spaces were enough.\n   **(since v1.5.0)**\n \n * **simpleLineBreaks**: (boolean) [default false] Parses line breaks as <br> like GitHub does, without\n   needing 2 spaces at the end of the line **(since v1.5.1)**\n \n   ```md\n   a line  \n   wrapped in two\n   ```\n    \n   turns into:\n    \n   ```html\n   <p>a line<br>\n   wrapped in two</p>\n   ```\n\n * **requireSpaceBeforeHeadingText**: (boolean) [default false] Makes adding a space between `#` and the header text mandatory **(since v1.5.3)**\n \n * **ghMentions**: (boolean) [default false] Enables github @mentions, which link to the username mentioned **(since v1.6.0)**\n \n * **ghMentionsLink**: (string) [default `https://github.com/{u}`] Changes the link generated by @mentions.\n   Showdown will replace `{u}` with the username. Only applies if ghMentions option is enabled.\n   Example: `@tivie` with ghMentionsOption set to `//mysite.com/{u}/profile` will result in `<a href=\"//mysite.com/tivie/profile\">@tivie</a>`\n \n * **encodeEmails**: (boolean) [default true] Enable e-mail addresses encoding through the use of Character Entities, transforming ASCII e-mail addresses into its equivalent decimal entities. (since v1.6.1)\n\n   NOTE: Prior to version 1.6.1, emails would always be obfuscated through dec and hex encoding.\n\n * **openLinksInNewWindow**: (boolean) [default false] Open all links in new windows\n   (by adding the attribute `target=\"_blank\"` to `<a>` tags) **(since v1.7.0)**\n\n * **backslashEscapesHTMLTags**: (boolean) [default false] Support for HTML Tag escaping. ex: `\\<div>foo\\</div>` **(since v1.7.2)**\n\n * **emoji**: (boolean) [default false] Enable emoji support. Ex: `this is a :smile: emoji`\n   For more info on available emojis, see https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Emojis **(since v.1.8.0)**\n\n * **underline**: (boolean) [default false] ***EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE*** Enable support for underline.\n   Syntax is **double** or **triple** **underscores** ex: `__underlined word__`. With this option enabled, underscores are no longer parses into `<em>` and `<strong>`.\n\n * **completeHTMLDocument**: (boolean) [default false] Outputs a complete html document,\n   including `<html>`, `<head>` and `<body>` tags' instead of an HTML fragment. (since v.1.8.5)\n\n * **metadata**: (boolean) [default false] Enable support for document metadata (defined at the top of the document\n   between `«««` and `»»»` or between `---` and `---`).  (since v.1.8.5)\n   \n   ```js\n   var conv = new showdown.Converter({metadata: true});\n   var html = conv.makeHtml(someMd);\n   var metadata = conv.getMetadata(); // returns an object with the document metadata\n   ```\n\n * **splitAdjacentBlockquotes**: (boolean) [default false] Split adjacent blockquote blocks.(since v.1.8.6)\n\n**NOTE**: Please note that until **version 1.6.0**, all of these options are ***DISABLED*** by default in the cli tool.\n\n\n## Flavors\n\nYou can also use flavors or presets to set the correct options automatically, so that showdown behaves like popular markdown flavors.\n\nCurrently, the following flavors are available:\n\n * original - original markdown flavor as in [John Gruber's spec](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)\n * vanilla  - showdown base flavor (as from v1.3.1)\n * github   - GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)\n\n\n### Global\n```javascript\nshowdown.setFlavor('github');\n```\n\n### Instance\n```javascript\nconverter.setFlavor('github');\n```\n\n\n## CLI Tool\n\nShowdown also comes bundled with a Command Line Interface tool. You can check the [CLI wiki page][cli-wiki] for more info\n\n## Integration with AngularJS\n\nShowdownJS project also provides seamlessly integration with AngularJS via a \"plugin\".\nPlease visit https://github.com/showdownjs/ngShowdown for more information.\n\n## Integration with TypeScript\n\nIf you're using TypeScript you maybe want to use the types from [DefinitelyTyped][definitely-typed]\n\n## Integration with SystemJS/JSPM\n\nIntegration with SystemJS can be obtained via the third party [\"system-md\" plugin](https://github.com/guybedford/system-md).\n\n## XSS vulnerability\n\nShowdown doesn't sanitize the input. This is by design since markdown relies on it to allow certain features to be correctly parsed into HTML.\nThis, however, means XSS injection is quite possible.\n\nPlease refer to the wiki article [Markdown's XSS Vulnerability (and how to mitigate it)][xss-wiki]\nfor more information.\n\n## Extensions\n\nShowdown allows additional functionality to be loaded via extensions. (you can find a list of known showdown extensions [here][ext-wiki])\nYou can also find a boilerplate, to create your own extensions in [this repository][boilerplate-repo]\n\n### Client-side Extension Usage\n\n```html\n<script src=\"showdown.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"twitter-extension.js\"></script>\n<script>\nvar converter = new showdown.Converter({ extensions: ['twitter'] });\n</script>\n```\n\n### Server-side Extension Usage\n\n```js\nvar showdown    = require('showdown'),\n    myExtension = require('myExtension'),\n    converter = new showdown.Converter({ extensions: ['myExtension'] });\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nA suite of tests is available which require node.js.  Once node is installed, run the following command from\nthe project root to install the dependencies:\n\n    npm install\n\nOnce installed the tests can be run from the project root using:\n\n    npm test\n\nNew test cases can easily be added.  Create a markdown file (ending in `.md`) which contains the markdown to test.\nCreate a `.html` file of the exact same name.  It will automatically be tested when the tests are executed with `mocha`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you wish to contribute please read the following quick guide.\n\n### Want a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue. If you would like to implement a new feature feel free to issue a\nPull Request.\n\n\n### Pull requests (PRs)\nPRs are awesome. However, before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:\n\n - Search GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n - When issuing PRs that change code, make your changes in a new git branch based on master:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\n   ```\n\n - Documentation (i.e: README.md) changes can be made directly against master.\n - Run the full test suite before submitting and make sure all tests pass (obviously =P).\n - Try to follow our [**coding style rules**][coding-rules].\n   Breaking them prevents the PR to pass the tests.\n - Refrain from fixing multiple issues in the same pull request. It's preferable to open multiple small PRs instead of one\n   hard to review big one.\n - If the PR introduces a new feature or fixes an issue, please add the appropriate test case.\n - We use commit notes to generate the changelog. It's extremely helpful if your commit messages adhere to the\n [**AngularJS Git Commit Guidelines**][ng-commit-guide].\n - If we suggest changes then:\n     - Make the required updates.\n     - Re-run the Angular test suite to ensure tests are still passing.\n     - Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request):\n\n     ```bash\n     git rebase master -i\n     git push origin my-fix-branch -f\n     ```\n - After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch.\n\nIf you have time to contribute to this project, we feel obliged that you get credit for it.\nThese rules enable us to review your PR faster and will give you appropriate credit in your GitHub profile.\nWe thank you in advance for your contribution!\n\n### Joining the team\nWe're looking for members to help maintaining Showdown.\nPlease see [this issue](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/issues/114) to express interest or comment on this note.\n\n## Credits\nFull credit list at https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/blob/master/CREDITS.md\n\nShowdown is powered by:<br/>\n[![webstorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/documentation/docs/logo_webstorm.png)](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)\n\n\n\n[sd-logo]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/showdownjs/logo/master/dist/logo.readme.png\n[legacy-branch]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/tree/legacy\n[releases]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/releases\n[changelog]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md\n[wiki]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki\n[cli-wiki]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/CLI-tool\n[definitely-typed]: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/showdown\n[xss-wiki]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Markdown's-XSS-Vulnerability-(and-how-to-mitigate-it)\n[ext-wiki]: https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/extensions\n[coding-rules]: https://github.com/showdownjs/code-style/blob/master/README.md\n[ng-commit-guide]: https://github.com/showdownjs/code-style/blob/master/README.md#commit-message-convention\n[boilerplate-repo]: https://github.com/showdownjs/extension-boilerplate\n",
