[**Snyk Open Source**](https://snyk.io/product/open-source-security-management/): Find and automatically fix open source vulnerabilities\n2. [**Snyk Code**](https://snyk.io/product/snyk-code/): Find and fix vulnerabilities in your application code in real time\n3. [**Snyk Container**](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/): Find and fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes applications\n4. [**Snyk Infrastructure as Code**](https://snyk.io/product/infrastructure-as-code-security/): Find and fix insecure configurations in Terraform and Kubernetes code\n\n[Learn more about what Snyk can do and sign up for a free account Â»](https://snyk.io)\n\n# What is Snyk CLI?\n\nSnyk CLI brings the functionality of [Snyk](https://snyk.io) into your development workflow. It can be run locally or in your CI/CD pipeline to scan your projects for security issues.\n\n## Supported languages and tools\n\nSnyk supports many languages and tools, including Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python, Golang, PHP, C/C++, Ruby, Scala and more. See our [Language Support documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360020352437-Language-support-summary).\n\nCLI also supports [Docker scanning](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360003946897-Snyk-Container-security-overview) and [Terraform, k8s and other Infrastructure as Code files scanning](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360001342678-Infrastructure-as-code).\n\n---\n\n# Install Snyk CLI\n\nSnyk CLI can be installed through multiple channels.\n\n## Install with npm or Yarn\n\n[Snyk CLI is available as an npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/snyk). If you have Node.js installed locally, you can install it by running:\n\n```bash\nnpm install snyk@latest -g\n```\n\nor if you are using Yarn:\n\n```bash\nyarn global add snyk\n```\n\n## More installation methods\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Standalone executables (macOS, Linux, Windows)</summary>\n\n### Standalone executables\n\nUse [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/snyk/snyk/releases) to download a standalone executable of Snyk CLI for your platform.\n\nWe also provide these standalone executables on our official CDN. See [the `release.json` file](https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json) for the download links:\n\n```http\nhttps://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/release.json\n\n# Or for specific version or platform\nhttps://static.snyk.io/cli/v1.666.0/release.json\nhttps://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos\n```\n\nFor example, to download and run the latest Snyk CLI on macOS, you could run:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos -o snyk\nchmod +x ./snyk\nmv ./snyk /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nYou can also use these direct links to download the executables:\n\n- macOS: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-macos\n- Windows: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-win.exe\n- Linux: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-linux\n- Alpine: https://static.snyk.io/cli/latest/snyk-alpine\n\nDrawback of this method is, that you will have to manually keep the Snyk CLI up to date.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Install with Homebrew (macOS, Linux)</summary>\n\n### Homebrew\n\nInstall Snyk CLI from [Snyk tap](https://github.com/snyk/homebrew-tap) with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) by running:\n\n```bash\nbrew tap snyk/tap\nbrew install snyk\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Scoop (Windows)</summary>\n\n### Scoop\n\nInstall Snyk CLI from our [Snyk bucket](https://github.com/snyk/scoop-snyk) with [Scoop](https://scoop.sh) on Windows:\n\n```\nscoop bucket add snyk https://github.com/snyk/scoop-snyk\nscoop install snyk\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Snyk CLI in a Docker image</summary>\n\n### Snyk CLI in a Docker image\n\nSnyk CLI can also be run from a Docker image. Snyk offers multiple Docker images under [snyk/snyk-cli](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk-cli) and [snyk/snyk](https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk) ([snyk/images on GitHub](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-images) for more details).\n\nThese images wrap the Snyk CLI and depending on the Tag come with a relevant tooling for different projects. For example scanning a Gradle project with snyk/snyk-cli:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -it\n    -e \"SNYK_TOKEN=<TOKEN>\"\n    -e \"USER_ID=1234\"\n    -v \"<PROJECT_DIRECTORY>:/project\"\n    -v \"/home/user/.gradle:/home/node/.gradle\"\n  snyk/snyk-cli:gradle-5.4 test --org=my-org-name\n```\n\n</details>\n\n## Install as a part of a Snyk CLI integration\n\nSnyk also offers many integrations into developer tooling. These integrations will install and manage the Snyk CLI for you. For example:\n\n- [Snyk Jenkins plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/snyk-security-scanner-plugin)\n- [CircleCI Orb](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-orb)\n- [Azure Pipelines Task](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-azure-pipelines-task)\n- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/snyk/actions)\n- [IntelliJ IDE Plugin](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-intellij-plugin)\n- [VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=snyk-security.snyk-vulnerability-scanner)\n- [Eclipse IDE Extension](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-eclipse-plugin)\n- [Maven plugin](https://github.com/snyk/snyk-maven-plugin)\n- And many more. See [the Integrations documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360000598398-Integrations)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/categories/360000598398-Integrations\">\n    <img src=\"help/ide.svg\" alt=\"Snyk CLI IDE integration\" width=\"50%\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n# Getting started with Snyk CLI\n\nOnce you installed the Snyk CLI, you can verify it's working by running\n\n```bash\nsnyk --version\n```\n\n## Authorization\n\nSnyk CLI depends on [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io) APIs. Connect your Snyk CLI with [Snyk.io](https://snyk.io) by running:\n\n```bash\nsnyk auth\n```\n\n## Scanning your project\n\nIf you are already in a folder with a supported project, start by running:\n\n```bash\nsnyk test\n```\n\nOr scan a Docker image by its tag with [Snyk Container](https://snyk.io/product/container-vulnerability-management/):\n\n```bash\nsnyk container test ubuntu:18.04\n```\n\nOr a k8s file:\n\n```bash\nsnyk iac test /path/to/kubernetes_file.yaml\n```\n\n## Monitoring your project\n\nSnyk can also monitor your project periodically and alert you for new vulnerabilities. The `snyk monitor` is similar to `snyk test` and can be used to create a project on the Snyk website that will be continuously monitored for new vulnerabilities.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://snyk.io\">\n    <img src=\"help/monitor.svg\" alt=\"Snyk CLI monitor projects\" width=\"70%\" />\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n```\n> snyk monitor\nMonitoring /project (project-name)...\n\nExplore this snapshot at https://app.snyk.io/org/my-org/project/29361c2c-9005-4692-8df4-88f1c040fa7c/history/e1c994b3-de5d-482b-9281-eab4236c851e\n\nNotifications about newly disclosed issues related to these dependencies will be emailed to you.\n```\n\n### Add Snyk to your CI/CD\n\nSnyk is really powerful when you are continuously scanning and monitoring your projects for vulnerabilities.\n\nUse one of [our integrations](#install-as-a-part-of-a-snyk-cli-integration) to stay secure.\n\nYou can authorize Snyk CLI in your CI/CD programatically:\n\n```bash\n# Using a SNYK_TOKEN envvar (preferred)\nSNYK_TOKEN=<SNYK_API_TOKEN> snyk test\n\n# Or using a Snyk auth command\nsnyk auth <SNYK_API_TOKEN>\nsnyk test\n```\n\n## More flags and options to try\n\nHere are some flags that you might find useful:\n\n- `--severity-threshold=low|medium|high|critical`\n\n  Only report vulnerabilities of provided level or higher.\n\n- `--json`\n\n  Prints results in JSON format.\n\n- `--all-projects`\n\n  Auto-detect all projects in working directory\n\nSee all the available commands and options by running `--help`:\n\n```bash\nsnyk --help\n# or get help for a specific command like\nsnyk iac --help\nsnyk code --help\n```\n\n# Getting support\n\nWe recommend reaching out via the [support@snyk.io](mailto:support@snyk.io) email whenever you need help with Snyk CLI or Snyk in general.\n\nGitHub Issues on any [Snyk project](https://github.com/snyk) are not actively monitored by Snyk support.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project is open source but we don't encourage outside contributors.\n\nThis repository is a monorepo, also covering other projects and tools:\n\n- [`@snyk/protect`](packages/snyk-protect): [npm package for `snyk-protect` command](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@snyk/protect)\n\n## Security\n\nFor any security issues or concerns, please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) file in this repository.\n\nMade with ð by Snyk\n",
